The work here is 3-folds, </br>
Quantum state preparation : We will be optimizating adiabatic state preparation using linear interpolaration from a $\sigma_z$ 
Hamiltonian to ground state Hamiltonian of $SbH$ molecule in Kramer restricted approach CAS(2,2). In other words, efficient gate 
decomposition for NMR Pulses. 
</br>
Interative Phase Estimation Algorithm : I have implemented couple of iterations, next step is to do more, atleast 10 to get higher 
accuracy in energy estimation. In principle, we can get any arbitrary level accuracy. </br> 

IBM Cloud for quantum computing : We can be little more adventourous with this one once above 2 are done and done.
